Changes from interim 1.02 (Developmental) releases

=== SGADE Library

* SoBkg
- Added SoBkgDrawString() function to draw a string to a tiled background
- Fixed bug in code to clear background 
- Added new SoBkgFill, SoBkgClearIndirect functions
- Changed SoBkgSetup to automatically reset the bkg scroll offset
- Modified all SoBkgWrite* functions to wrap instead of truncating when the
  data goes off the edge of the screen.  This is required to support the new
  SoBkgMap module

* SoBkgCreditScroll
- New scrolling credits module

* Added SoBkgFont -- new module for tile-based fonts

* SoBkgMap
- Renamed old SoBkgMap structure to "SoTileMap"
- Implemented new SoBkgMap module to support arbitrarily large virtual
  scrolling tile maps

* SoBkgMemManager
- Fixed which caused crashes when using tilesets with an odd number of tiles

* SoDebug
- Added SoDebugPrintf() and support function dstrnlen()
- Added several debug printing helper functions

* SoDisplay
- Modified SoDisplaySetMode function to clear all active effect bits and to
  always default the display priority of bitmap backgrounds to 3 (lowest)

* SoDMA
- Added three new DMA macro functions: SO_DMA_MEMCPY, SO_DMA_MEMCPY_REV,
  SO_DMA_MEMSET all three use DMA channel 3 and provide a simplified API
  for common memory functions
- Changed Bkg & Tile functions to use DMA in place of copy-loops

* SoImage
- Added SoImageBkgLoad() function to load a linear image buffer to tile BKG

* SoKeys
- Added key repeat support functions in SoKeys (not yet fully functional)

* SoMath
- Added new SO_ABS (absolute value) to SoMath.h

* SoMode4Renderer
- Fixed bug in SoMode4RendererDrawCrossFadeImage()
- Removed redundant code in SoMode4RendererDrawNumber

* SoSprite
- Added SoSpriteSetPriority function to set sprite display priorities

* SoSpriteMemManager
- Added SoSpriteMemManagerCopyFromImage() copies graphic from image to existing
  sprite
- Added SoSpriteMemManagerLoadFromImage() loads graphic from image to new
  sprite

* SoTile
- Added SoTileSetCopyFromLinearBuffer() - converts linear image layout to tile
  layout

* SoTimer
- Added SoTimerClockGetTotalMilliseconds() returns elapsed milliseconds since
  clock start
- Added SoTimerClockGetTotalSeconds() to get total elapsed seconds since start
- Fixed bug in SoTimerClockGetTotalSeconds()

* Completed conversion of Visual Studio workspace to Visual Studio .NET format
* Added new 'rebuild' make target to do complete clean rebuilds
* Converted many class accessor functions to macros
* Did clean-up editing on the comments in about 50% of the source files

=== SGADE Tools

* Extended SoConvert tool to support Tile-based images.  The sample ROM's data
  directory includes a SoConvert script that uses this feature.

=== SGADE Sample

* Added demonstration of SoBkgMap to the Sample ROM


SGADE Release 1.01 -- July 30, 2002

* Formalized licensing terms.  Details can be found in SoLicense.txt
* Changed name to Socrates Gameboy Advance Development Engine (used to be 'Environment')
          to reflect the fact that it's really "just a library".
* Added SoBkg, SoBkgMemManager, SoBkgMap, SoBkgFont classes
- SoBkg            holds all functions related to handling specific backgrounds
- SoBkgMemManager  handles dynamic loading of tile graphics data to BG VRAM as it is used
- SoBkgMap         holds tile index data for backgrounds (also placeholder for code to handle
                   the dynamic loading of tile index data to backgrounds)
- SoBkgFont        (just a placeholder for now) handles mapping of character values to
                   tile graphics
* Added SoDisplaySetMode, SoDisplayGetMode and SoDisplayEnable functions.  Modified SoMode4Renderer
        to call SoDisplaySetMode
* Added complete general memory allocator SoMemManager
* Added SoTileSetBkgLoad function to load tile date to BG VRAM
* Added tile-mode demo to Sample
* Added debug printing and breakpoint support for the BATGBA emulator
* Added several debug printing helper functions
* Added SO_MIN and SO_MAX macros to SoMath.h
* Added SoMathFixedMultiplyByFraction function -- this is a full-precision fixed-point
        multiply function that only works when the second argument is less than 1.0.
        Modified SoCameraDistanceToFrustumPlane to use this new (faster) function
* Updated library make file to include header file dependencies
* Added Visual Studio .NET solution format project file

SGADE Release 1.00 -- stability release June 8, 2002

* Added new 'sofixedpoint' data type to show explicitly what values are expected
  to be in fixed point and what values are not.  All functions that expect fixed
  point values now use the new typedef.  Unfortunately, as always, there are
  exceptions; objects/functions that can work with either fixed-point or whole
  values (e.g. SoVector* objects, Multiply/Divide functions) have been left unchanged.
* Split simple cube mesh source out of SoMesh.c into separate source file (SoMeshCube.c)
* Added SO_DEPRECATED_FUNCTION macro & actually removed all deprecated functions
  (there were only three of them: SoSystemInitialize, SoIntManagerAddInterruptHandler,
  and SoIntManagerRemoveInterruptHandler)
* Fixes for 16.16 format numbers (SO_FIXED_ONE_OVER_SLOW_ACCURATE, SoMathSqrt,
  SoCameraInitialize)
* Fixes for linkage with C++ (corrected 'extern "C"' declarations)
* Replaced interrupt SoIntManagerInterruptHandler function with assembly code based
  on one of the handlers in Jeff Frowein's crt0.s
* Corrected expected vertex order in SoMode4PolygonRasterizerDrawSolidTriangleC() &
  SoMode4PolygonRasterizerDrawSolidTriangle() and added checks for degenerate triangles
* Added accurate/safe fixed-point multiply function: SoMathFixedMultiply().  The
  SoCameraDistanceToFrustumPlane() function was changed to use this as it needs the
  accuracy and is susceptable to fixed point overflow.
* Renamed SoMathSqrt to SoMathFixedSqrt & deprecated old name.
* Cleaned up Doxygen errors & touched up documentation source

Some time ago: Changed all fixed point stuff from 17.15 to 16.16. Still doesn't work completely though. The 3D pipeline is broken now. 
			   Needs to be fixed. But at the moment I'm not sure where exactly this is located....
Some time ago: Rewrote the interrupt handler in Arm assembly. Only works on Mappy though. Needs to be fixed.
28-4-2002: Fixed incredibly stupid bug in SoSpriteManager.c on line 246.
 3-3-2002: Fixed bug in SO_FIXED_MULTIPLY_SMALL_SMALL
20-3-2002: From now on, only a thumb-interwork library is generated.
19-3-2002: Assembly files are now all with capital S instead of .s. Now GCC can parse them.
18-3-2002: Rewrote the interrupt system, it's simpler thus faster now, we were doing too
		   much in our interrupt handler anyway.
18-3-2002: Fixed bugs in SoMultiPlayer module, it works now, but needs care, and a 
		   little todo still. But it's in a usable state.
17-3-2002: Finished new font system;
16-3-2002: SoConverter no longer uses GetLongPathName, cause that didn't work in Win95. It
		   now uses FindFirstFile iterating over all URL parts. Thanks Gabriele :) hehe.
16-3-2002: Fixed bug in SoConverter input (converter selection)
14-3-2002: SoMode4RendererDrawImage* functions now take SoImage structures.
14-3-2002: Added Matt Hattems debug prints for MBV2 and Mappy environments. Thanks Mattem!
14-3-2002: New files: SoDebug.h and .c. These now contain the assertion stuff;
14-3-2002: -------------- Major overhaul ----------------------------
		   Altough most changes are listed below, some other might have  slipped through.
		   the new release after 14-3 has changed quite a bit, and I suggest approaching
		   it carefully. It might bite. Mwuhauahahaha
		   ----------------------------------------------------------
13-3-2002: Sprites now use the SoSpriteAnimation structure.
13-3-2002: Finished a FLC loader, but it seems to contain some bugs. Damnit.
12-3-2002: SoTexture disappeared and is now replaced by the new and more generic 
		   structure SoImage.
12-3-2002: SoTileSet structure changed rigorously. Please see the code.
12-3-2002: SoConverter tool finally done.
 8-3-2002: SoSpriteMemManagerLoad now uses a DMA copy.
 8-3-2002: Changed SoTextureGetTexture to SoTextureGetData to be consistent with SoTileSetGetData
 7-3-2002: Fixed bug in mosaic register setting, because that register turned out to be write only.
 7-3-2002: Fixed bug in SoKeysUpdate which made SoKeysPressed() and SoKeysRelease() simply not work..
 7-3-2002: SocratesInitialize() has become SoSystemInitialize()
 7-3-2002: Renamed Socrates.h to SoSystem.h and create a new file Socrates.h which includes
		   all other headers. Now people only need to link the library, and include single header.
 7-3-2002: Removed the dis-assembly locators. Never used them anymore, and I doubt anybody else did.
 7-3-2002: Fixed bug in SoBackgroundManagerSetMosaic and SoSpriteManagerSetMosaic
 6-3-2002: Took the restructuring one step further, making Socrates a seperate .a library.
 3-3-2002: Fixed bug in SoSpriteManagerDisableSprites
 3-3-2002: Sprite manager no longer uses the VBlank interrupt handler, you have to call 
 		   an update yourself now. This fixes the 'jumpy' sprite bug.
 3-3-2002: Added guards around true, false, NULL and bool defines in Socrates.h
 3-3-2002: Changed the SoKeys module to a more flexible system. Still contains some bugs though...
 3-3-2002: Fixed bug in SoTimer.c
 2-3-2002: Switched from NMake to GNU Make so people don't need Visual Studio anymore. It
 		   can still be used if wanted though. The Visual Studio project simply calls the
		   GNU-make tool.
 2-3-2002: Removed SoLinkScript and SoBoot.s, and replaced them with Jeff's Devrs crt0.S and lnkscript 
		   in the build directory.
 2-3-2002: Changed the directory and build structure to a more clean one. Seperated application from library.	
 6-2-2002: Rewrote the sine and reciprocal tables to allow simpler changing of SO_FIXED_Q.
 6-2-2002: Moved the background mosaic stuff from SoDisplay to SoBackgroundManager.
 6-2-2002: Added the SoTileSetGetTileNumIndices method to the SoTileSet module for easy
 		   sprite animation.
 5-2-2002: Added the SoFlashMem module to the makefile (it wasn't linked in), thanks Benjamin!
 5-2-2002: New files: SoBackgroundManager.c and SoBackgroundManager.h
 5-2-2002: Gabriele wrote the SoEffects module.
 5-2-2002: New files: SoEffects.c and SoEffects.h
 5-2-2002: Added all mosaic functions to both SoDisplay (for backgrounds, will be moved
 		   to an SoBackgroundManager module later) and SoSpriteManager.
 4-2-2002: New files: SoWindow.c and SoWindow.h
 4-2-2002: Gabriele wrote a SoWindow module. It handles the two GBA windows. Excellent work
 		   Gabriele! I could add it without problems!
 3-2-2002: Started working on the SoSound module. It's experimental only and no clean interface
 		   is defined yet. So don't use it :).
 3-2-2002: New files: SoSound.c and SoSound.h
 2-2-2002: Fixed bug in polygon clipper where all vertices are out of the frustum, yet 
		   the polygon is still visible (Thanks Gabriele).
 2-2-2002: Chanced naming of SoTransformSetTranslate to SoTransformSetTranslation and
 		   SoTransformReset to SoTransformMakeIdentity to improve consistency with 
 		   the SoMatrix module. Also changed SoCameraSetTranslate to SoCameraSetTranslation.
 		   (Thanks Gabriele).
